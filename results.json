    "title": "Escaping the middle-income trap",
    "link": "https://thesun.my/opinion-news/escaping-the-middle-income-trap-IE15004639",
    "description": "THE spectre of the “middle-income trap” haunts many nations. Having clawed their way out of poverty through grit and low-cost manufacturing, they find progress stalling. Wages rise, eroding their competitive edge against poorer rivals, yet they lack the advanced technology and productivity to compete with wealthier nations. It becomes an economic purgatory. The diagnoses often point to two flaws: over-dependence on cheap labour and chronically low investment in innovation. Malaysia is among many. Having examined the evidence, the arguments are not only persuasive but fundamental to understanding and eventually escaping this trap.Relying primarily on low wages is a strategy with an expiration date. As economies grow, basic supply and demand will push wages up. Workers will demand better living standards. Suddenly, factories producing simple garments or assembling basic electronics will find themselves undercut by nations entering the development ladder with even lower costs, like Vietnam or Bangladesh, previously undercutting China. This model creates a fragile economy – global demand shifts or automation can devastate sectors built solely on cost arbitrage. Profits are thin, capital accumulation is slow and reinvestment in upgrading is difficult. The workforce is not pushed or trained to handle more complex tasks, hindering upward mobility. This is where the second flaw becomes crippling. Without significant, sustained investment in research and development (R&D) and the absorption of new technologies, economies cannot climb the value chain. Low innovation investment means efficiency gains will stall. Output per worker will not increase sufficiently to justify higher wages without losing competitiveness and countries will remain stuck producing low-margin goods, unable to create or adopt high-value products and services. Bright minds will seek opportunities elsewhere and domestic firms will lack the capacity to innovate, missing out on new markets.Breaking free requires a deliberate, often difficult, shift in economic strategy. Massive, targeted investment in human capital is imperative. This goes beyond basic literacy; it means providing high-quality STEM education, world-class universities and lifelong vocational training aligned with future industries. Skills must constantly evolve. Governments must lead in R&D spending (3%+ of GDP) through direct funding, powerful tax incentives and creating robust research institutions. Malaysia now spends around 1% GDP on R&D. Crucially, private sector R&D must increase.Foster dynamic innovation ecosystem This requires strong intellectual property rights to incentivise invention and attract foreign tech. We need venture capital funding for risky, long-term bets. University-industry linkages need strengthening to turn academic research into marketable products. There should also be digital and physical infrastructure for high-speed internet, reliable power and efficient logistics. Governments must identify and nurture nascent high-potential sectors (for example, green tech, advanced manufacturing, AI and specialised services) – not through protectionism but by facilitating technology transfer, providing temporary support and demanding performance benchmarks. Move beyond just exporting cheap goods – attract high-value foreign direct investment, integrate global knowledge networks and leverage trade agreements for technology access.South Korea stands not just as an example but as the definitive case study in escaping the middle-income trap through this formula. Korea consciously moved away from pure cheap labour in textiles and shoes in the 1970s and 80s. It made a massive, state-backed bet on heavy industry (shipbuilding and steel) and on technology (electronics and semiconductors). Korea now consistently ranks among the world’s top R&D spenders as a percentage of GDP (over 4%). This wasn’t accidental; it was a national priority driven by government policy and massive corporate investment. A relentless focus on education, particularly in technical fields, created a highly skilled workforce capable of driving complex industries. The government provided direction, subsidies and protection while demanding export performance and technological upgrading from giant conglomerates. However, this model also had downsides – inequality and cronyism – but it delivered the technological leap. Korea transformed from a war-torn agrarian economy to a global leader in electronics, automobiles and pop culture within two generations. It did not just escape the middle-income trap; it soared into the high-income stratosphere.The diagnosis is sound: overreliance on cheap labour is a dead end and chronic under-investment in innovation is a recipe for stagnation. South Korea’s extraordinary journey provides the most compelling evidence that escaping the trap is possible but it requires immense political will, strategic vision and sustained, massive investment in people and technology. It demands moving from imitation to creation. For nations currently trapped, the path is clear: break the addiction to cheap wages and ignite an innovation revolution. The alternative is to remain forever on the treadmill, watching the world race ahead. The Korean model isn’t perfect, nor easily replicated in full, but its core lessons – prioritise education, invest ruthlessly in R&D and strategically target high-value industries – are the indispensable keys to unlocking sustained prosperity. The trap is not destiny but escape, which demands a fundamental rewrite of the economic playbook.

Kena fokus pada R&D, teknologi canggih, dan kemahiran tinggi untuk pekerja kita.\n\nTengoklah Korea Selatan, mereka berjaya keluar dari perangkap ni dengan melabur gila-gila dalam industri berat dan teknologi. Memang perlukan komitmen dan perancangan yang kuat.\n\nIni bukan takdir, tapi peluang untuk kita ubah cara main ekonomi kita!",

    "title": "Seizing a 21st Century Cognitive Advantage.",
    "link": "https://www.thecipherbrief.com/21st-century-cognitive-advantage",
    "description": "OPINION — In 1943, a body washed up on a beach in Huelva, Spain. It was the body of a Royal Marine officer, Major William Martin. Martin was carrying papers, cuffed to his wrist in a briefcase, suggesting that the Allies would invade Greece and Sardinia, not Sicily. Spain was officially neutral, but a few Spanish officials sympathetic to the Nazis allowed German agents to discreetly photograph the documents before Spain quietly passed the documents to the British. Those British officials appeared to be in a state of panic over the lost briefcase.Would this opportunistic espionage expose a critical Allied operation? In reality, Major William Martin never existed. The body was that of Glyndwr (“Glendure”) Michael, a Welsh drifter who died from consuming rat poison. You probably recognize this as Operation Mincemeat. British intelligence developed this incredible ruse, with American approval, and painstakingly developed a plan for the body to wash up near Huelva Spain and provided background and a personal story for Michael that allowed the body to pass convincingly as a Royal Martine officer who perished at sea while delivering sensitive documents.The Germans took the bait. Convinced by this fabricated narrative, Hitler diverted significant forces away from Sicily. When the Allies landed in Sicily, they encountered far less resistance than expected, saving countless lives and accelerating the collapse of Axis defenses in southern Europe.Beyond innovation and sheer audacity, this was a master class in story-telling, in knowing the pressures facing the target audience (Hitler), in creating a believable altered reality, in understanding how information moved through Nazi circles and among those who enabled them and, most importantly, in persuading our adversaries to make consequential decisions that advanced our interests over theirs. It was cognitive warfare on the offense, it represented a cognitive advantage during a perilous period, and it remains a reminder of the timeless power of cognitive persuasion.History has many other examples of where commanders and leaders have stepped beyond traditional thinking and conventional operations into the information and cognitive space to confuse our adversaries, to win the day, and, at times, to change history.Is this important today? Let us put cognitive warfare in strategic perspective. First, great power competition is intensifying and the stakes are high. The U.S is now facing the most significant global challenges than at any time in our history. We face more capable peer adversaries, more aspiring regional nations, and more proxy threats than ever before. The global environment is more uncertain than ever, and our place in it is not guaranteed. If we are to remain the global leader, we’ll have to be ready for today’s and tomorrow’s rapidly evolving competition and warfare. We must look to prioritize and commonly orient our Nation’s capabilities toward actively maneuvering and gaining advantage across the cognitive landscape to help ensure our security interests, and to actively deny any adversary their own advantage. Second, great powers will go to great lengths to avoid direct military engagement that could have catastrophic consequences. Russia has lost the equivalent of what would be one of the world’s largest militaries and it has experienced a massive reduction in national power in the war with Ukraine. We also know the examples from WWII when nations and great militaries were defeated and even decimated as a result of great power conflict.China has advocated winning without fighting for decades, and it still does. Khrushchev famously said “We will take American without firing a shot. We do not have to invade the U.S. We will destroy you from within.” Putin is a believer and practitioner in that approach.Their approaches are not a mystery. Our adversaries have telegraphed how they plan to attack us, and to defeat us, without direct military engagement.Third, given those considerations, our adversaries are increasingly relying on operations in the gray zone, or gray warfare, to advance their national interests and to take steps to undermine and weaken the United States, without risking a superpower conflict. They have prioritized their resources, decisions, and actions toward this end.China and Russia, and even Iran and North Korea, believe there are more gains than risks in the gray zone, and any risks they do face are manageable, so we should expect them to expand their activities. If we solely maintain an unblinking stare at the conventional military capabilities of our adversaries, we might miss the real war already well underway in the gray zone.Finally—cognitive warfare stands as the most prevalent and consequential activity our adversaries conduct in the gray zone.This is not your grandfather’s Cold War disinformation. This is an assault on cognition, powered by advanced technology and enabled by an information environment that provides camouflage, infrastructure, and operational resources for our adversaries. Ultimately, cognitive warfare is a contest for truth and knowledge—a struggle to shape perception, control understanding, and influence both the decision-making process and its outcomes.The Cipher Brief brings expert-level context to national and global security stories. It’s never been more important to understand what’s happening in the world. Upgrade your access to exclusive content by becoming a subscriber.Never before in history have individuals, organizations, societies, and nations faced such a sustained assault on our ability to make our own decisions—our autonomy to think, decide, and act in our own best interests. From our adversaries’ perspective, controlling perceptions, manufacturing realities, steering decision-making, intimidation as persuasion, decision fatigue, and manufactured false choices make for persuasive and effective strategy.In this global information landscape, where technology levels the playing field, any individual or group, and state or non-state actors can reach global audiences almost immediately. Thousands of internet sites, fake users, fabricated organizations, bots, and willing surrogates, managed by Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea, wage cognitive warfare against the U.S., our allies, and our partners at unprecedented scale and velocity. Artificial intelligence now serves as a force multiplier—amplifying reach, supercharging deception, automating the manipulation of public opinion, and constricting time in the information maneuver space.As individuals and groups within America, this is everything from how we see the world, how we vote, how we invest, whom and what we trust, which policies we support or oppose, and who we believe are our friends and partners—locally, regionally, and globally.For national security leaders, policymakers, and corporate and military decision-makers, our adversaries seek to influence consequential decisions on issues like Ukraine, Taiwan, trade, military posture, supply chains, alliances, participation in international organizations, technology development, and a host of other issues that could tip the balance in our adversaries’ favor.For China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, this is integrated national strategy where the instruments of national power—government, private sector, and surrogates—are combined to achieve strategic impact. Further, the willingness of our adversaries to defy international law; challenge economic interests, and violate the sovereignty and laws of every country including the U.S.; engage in bribery, political coercion, sabotage, and assassinations—essentially a “no limits” approach” to cognitive warfare—gives them considerable leverage—made more effective by our lack of focused emphasis on recognizing, prioritizing and taking action to mass and commonly orient our great national strengths.If we are to make consequential decisions with confidence, we must have high certainty in the information we receive, value, and share. In the cognitive domain, truth is a strategic asset—precious, powerful, and fragile. To endure, it must be shielded from the relentless assault of manipulation, coercion, and altered realities initiated by our adversaries to shape the strategic landscape and create influence attack vectors intended to undermine and disable our ability to do the same.Churchill recognized both the strategic value and fragile nature of truth in a time of conflict. He famously said, “In wartime, the truth [is] so precious that it should always be attended by a bodyguard of lies.” The lesson is clear. Today, just as in 1943, we must seize and defend the cognitive advantage if we are to navigate these equally perilous times.What do we need to do to achieve a cognitive advantage? - First, we need to reassert a strong U.S. national narrative.In the cognitive domain, our national narrative is both sword and shield. It projects power, influence, and advances our interests. It tells the story of our values, our history, our aspirations, our view of the world, and our resolve and is reinforced by actions and deeds. Our military and economic strength and our global leaderships are strong parts of this narrative. It supports confidence in our actions, our institutions, and our commitments. It also counters adversary narratives and actions that seek to undermine America within our own borders and across the world. We all know today that our national narrative is being questioned by some at home and abroad. Regardless of how we see the political environment, we must articulate and advance a strong seamless U.S. national narrative as foundational to a cognitive advantage. We must take this on. - Second, we need to empower our master storytellers.Our master storytellers are not just communicators; they are architects of persuasion. We all know this; we read, we watch movies, and we listen. Facts are fleeting, but stories remain with us—they shape how we feel which in turn drives how we behave. In the cognitive domain, well-crafted stories—including those tailored to navigate today’s hyper-technical environment and chaotic information environment—shape threat perceptions, influence our perception of reality, sustain resolve, and can tip the balance in competition or conflict.Adversaries recognize the power of narrative and weaponize it; even the truth is more persuasive when it is delivered as part of a compelling story. History proves the advantage: in cognitive warfare, facts alone rarely shift outcomes—compelling narratives and persuasive storytelling do. As in 1943, our edge will be defined by those who can craft and deliver the stories that influence minds and shape events. Yes, we need our master storytellers as much today as we did in 1943. - Third, we need to see and understand our adversaries’ capabilities and intentions in the cognitive domain—where perception, knowledge, and decision-making are contested. Our adversaries, of course, go to great lengths to mask and conceal their activities. It is time for cognitive intelligence—intelligence in and about the cognitive domain and our ability to reliably understand how, where, and why adversaries seek to shape our thinking and decisions—to emerge as a priority. - Fourth, we need a sustain a technological edge in AI, Cognitive Science, Cyber, and other technologies that force our adversaries to go on the defensive. China in particular is working to take that advantage from us by its own means but also by stealing U.S. data, technologies, and intellectual property to use against us. We must safeguard the extraordinary capabilities of U.S. technologies—including those small, bold startups—that not only provide a critical national security advantage but are also relentlessly targeted by our adversaries. - Fifth—and critically important—we need to plan, organize and drive designed strategies and actions across our governmental institutions, international partners, and private sector at the intersections of shared security interests to defend against adversary tactics that target our economic, military, infrastructure, informational and Cyber pillars of security each fueled by human perception, reasoning, and effective decision-making. If you remember anything from this article, please remember this. As a priority, we need a strategy and a commitment to play offense in a quiet but relentless manner that confuses our adversaries, shatters their confidence, and forces them—not us—to deal with the uncertainties of cognitive warfare. - Finally, if all of this is to work, we need to harness the incredible intellectual power, critical thinking, and collaboration among government, private sector, academia, and in many cases, our allies. We need to work at the nexus of shared interests. In this collaboration; we need leaders; not to overly prescribe or to build bureaucracy, but to inspire, convene, add clarity of purpose, and to enable the incredible capability this community offers. We must use the power to convene to commonly inform and set conditions for mutually beneficial action and outcomes, and to help close the relationship seams used by our adversaries as attack vectors.

This is a time for vision, for big thoughts, innovation, and audacity. With those attributes, and thinking back to the remarkable achievements of 1943, today’s operations in the cognitive domain can and will do remarkable things.Those elements, we believe, are the foundation of a cognitive advantage. If we are successful, it means we have a sustained ability to protect our decision-making autonomy at all levels; we preserve domestic and allied social cohesion; we retain global influence, credibility and narrative power; we expose and undermine adversary efforts at cognitive warfare; and we achieve U.S. objectives without resulting in direct conflict. Challenging?—Yes. Attainable?—Certainly.A final word. Last June, Dave Pitts visited Normandy for the 80th Anniversary of D-Day—which was our last conventional war of great powers. It was a war that resulted in a devastating loss of human life and unprecedented destruction. Omaha Beach, the Drop Zones around St. Mere Eglise, and the American Cemetery were vivid reminders. That war established the U.S as a global superpower and established a world order that has lasted 80 years. It also enshrined in history the “Greatest Generation.”Today, authoritarian rule is on the rise, national sovereignty around the world is being undermined, and the global order as we know it is under attack. Once again, our preeminence, leadership, and resolve are being challenged. Let’s be clear, the next war—a quieter war, a gray war—is already underway. The outcome of that war will be as consequential as conventional war. Cognitive warfare may very well be the defining contest of this era—a generational challenge—given the threats it poses to U.S. national security, our place and influence in the world, and our commitment to our own self-determination. If you are a professional in this space—government, private sector, academia, and ally—this is clearly your time.Today, we are surrounded by threats, but we are also surrounded by opportunities, by extraordinary expertise, and by willing partners. The challenges ahead are formidable, but so are our experiences and capabilities as a nation. The incredible resolve, sacrifice, and refusal to fail—hallmarks of the Greatest Generation—are woven into the fabric of America and will continue to serve us well. Securing our future now demands leadership, collaboration, a bias for action, and adaptability—the hallmarks of this generation. We have what it takes.Yes, confidence is clearly justified—but we must just as clearly match that confidence with decisive action. Time is not on our side as others have already decided to prioritize cognitive related strategies. It is time to take a bold step forward in the cognitive domain and to seize the cognitive advantage.All statements of fact, opinion, or analysis expressed are those of the author and do not reflect the official positions or views of the U.S. Government.
